# MERN_STACK

Welcome to my MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack learning journey! This repository documents my progress, resources, and projects as I dive into mastering full-stack web development using the MERN stack.

## About the MERN Stack

The MERN stack is a popular technology stack for building dynamic web applications. It comprises four main technologies:

- **MongoDB**: A NoSQL database used for storing and managing data.
- **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for Node.js, used for building APIs and handling server-side logic.
- **React.js**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces and dynamic web applications.
- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side programming.

## Learning Resources

Here are some resources I'm using to learn the MERN stack:

- Online tutorials
- Documentation for each technology (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)
- YouTube video tutorials
- Books and online courses
- Code-along projects and exercises


## Goals

- Learn the fundamentals of MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js
- Build CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) applications using the MERN stack
- Gain experience in deploying MERN applications to hosting platforms like Heroku or AWS
- Collaborate with other developers on MERN stack projects
